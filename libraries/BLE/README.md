BLE for Arduino-Pico
Copyright (c) 2026 Earle F. Philhower, III.  All rights reserved.
LGPL licensed, see headers.

This library allows users to become BLE servers (i.e. the things that
your phone or PC connect to like a BLE heart rate monitor) or BLE
clients (things like your PC or phone that connect to remote devices).

This library was written from scratch to work with the Pico SDK's
BTStack Bluetooth driver.  It tries to be relatively compatible with
the ESP32 BLE and Arduino.cc ArduinoBLE libraries, but isn't
guaranteed to be so.

See the Arduino-Pico docs for full information.
